					<persName ref="#Andrews_Emma_B">Emma B. Andrews</persName> is best remembered
					for her association with the millionaire lawyer turned archaeologist/art and
					antiquities collector, <persName ref="#Davis_Theodore">Theodore M.
						Davis</persName>. Traveling to <placeName ref="#Egypt">Egypt</placeName>
					with him between 1889 and 1912, she kept detailed journals of these voyages
					along the <placeName ref="#Nile_River">Nile</placeName>, including his important
					yet under-reported excavations of 20 significant tombs in the <placeName
						ref="#Valley_of_the_Kings">Valley of the Kings</placeName>. <persName
						ref="#Andrews_Emma_B">Emma</persName> provides a vital commentary on the
					archaeology and pioneering Egyptologists of the time. She paints a revealing
					picture of the lives of the colonial gentry and the cultural and scientific
					literati in <placeName ref="#Egypt">Egypt</placeName> at the dawn of the
					twentieth century. To date, her diaries are unpublished; analysis of the
					contents of 19 volumes will afford scholars and a general audience information
					about an important historical resource for the first time. Since its inception
					in 2010, the scope of our project has broadened to include the transcription and
					digitization of a wide range of primary historical material from the 'Golden Age
					of Egyptian archaeology detailed in the Research section of this website. The
					Emma B. Andrews Diary Project is one of the founding partners of Newbook Digital
					Texts. We are proud to offer undergraduate and graduate Digital Humanities
					education and internships.</p>

					delightful one we have ever known - large airy appartments, with every luxury -
					perfect service - and food. My corner room is the most charming room I have ever
					seen - and the large sitting room next it is the same - and the string of
					bedrooms next the salon, made an imposing array. <persName

					She rises very early, and works in her garden of which she is extravagantly
					fond, and is now amusing herself in writing a history of her life. It is a
					pleasure to meet her and talk to her. We spent all afternoon with them, such a
					pleasant old Italian house just outside <placeName ref="#Florence"

					cold and windy.</p>

				<p>I only went into one church while here because of the cold, and <persName

						ref="#Basilica_of_Santa_Croce">S. Croce</placeName>, my favourite Florentine
					church, one morning. We were all devoted to <persName ref="#Davis_Theodore"
						>Theo</persName> - in his wretched state - and the last day of our stay we
					went out to <persName ref="#Costantini_David">David Costantini</persName>'s

				<p>We had 5 miserable days in <placeName ref="#Milan">Milan</placeName>. <persName
