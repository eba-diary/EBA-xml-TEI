                         <persName ref="#Andrews_Emma_B">Emma B. Andrews</persName> is best remembered
                         for her association with the millionaire lawyer turned archaeologist/art and

                         with him between 1889 and 1912, she kept detailed journals of these voyages

                                   ref="#Andrews_Emma_B">Emma</persName> provides a vital commentary on the
                         archaeology and pioneering Egyptologists of the time. She paints a revealing
                         picture of the lives of the colonial gentry and the cultural and scientific
                         literati in <placeName ref="#Egypt">Egypt</placeName> at the dawn of the
                         twentieth century. To date, her diaries are unpublished; analysis of the
                         contents of 19 volumes will afford scholars and a general audience information
                         about an important historical resource for the first time. Since its inception
                         in 2010, the scope of our project has broadened to include the transcription and
                         digitization of a wide range of primary historical material from the 'Golden
                         Age' of Egyptian archaeology detailed in the Research section of this website.
                         The Emma B. Andrews Diary Project is one of the founding partners of Newbook
                         Digital Texts. We are proud to offer undergraduate and graduate Digital

 			<persName ref="#Andrews_Emma">I</persName> did some shopping that day, went to the

			<p><placeName ref="#Genoa">Genoa</placeName> - we had such a tiresome voyage.  It was interesting seeing <geogName ref="#Corfu">Corfu</geogName> again - but 
			it added to the days.  <unclear>The German Emperor was there at his Castle - and 3 great 
			German Steamships in the harbour</unclear>.  We reached <placeName ref="#Naples">Naples</placeName> yesterday - but did not land

			which seems something like home.  Tomorrow we go to <placeName ref="#Florence">Florence</placeName>.</p>

			<p><persName ref="#Davis_Theodore">Theo</persName> and <persName ref="#Burton_Harry">Harry</persName> elected to go by motor here - and we went by train - we expected 
			them to arrive before we did, at 10 o’clock P.M.  But we passed them near <unclear>Spezia</unclear>, 
			the rain pouring in torrents - and we thought they would stop somewhere for the night.  
			But they did not arrive <pb n="102"/> until 12:30 - and <persName ref="#Jones_Daniel">Jones</persName> and <persName ref="#Andrews_Emma">I</persName> who were sitting up for them, were very anxious.  
			They had bad roads and continuous rain.  Our pleasure in being once more in <placeName ref="#Florence">Florence</placeName>, 
			was marred by an illness of <persName ref="#Davis_Theodore">Theodore’s</persName>.  It began with an ulcerated tooth, which 
			gave him extreme pain, but the dentist treated it, and we hoped it was over.  
			<persName ref="#Burton_Harry">Harry</persName> was every day at the hotel with us, and <persName ref="#Costantini_David">David Costantini</persName> was very kind 
			and devoted - and was with us almost every day, and motored and played cards with 
			<persName ref="#Davis_Theodore">Theodore</persName> - when the weather was good, which was seldom.  We had fires every day.  
			Pleasant visits with <persName ref="#Hagermeyer">the Hagermeyer’s</persName> and with <persName ref="#Kirk_Mr">the Kirks</persName> - old <persName ref="#Kirk_Mrs">Mrs. Kirk</persName> is very 
			remarkable.  She is 86 years old and as active mentally and physically as ever, 
			and very intelligent.  She rises very early, and works in her garden of which she 
			is extravagantly  fond, and is now amusing herself in writing a history of her life.  
			It is a pleasure to meet her and talk to her.  We spent all afternoon with them, 
			such a pleasant old Italian house just outside <placeName ref="#Florence">Florence</placeName> - we could only walk through 
			part of it, as it was cold and windy.</p>  

			<p>I only went into one church while here because of the cold, and <persName ref="#Buttles_Jeanette">Nettie</persName> and I went 
			into <placeName ref="#Basilica_of_Santa_Croce">S. Croce</placeName>, my favourite Florentine church, one morning.  We were all devoted to 
			<persName ref="#Davis_Theodore">Theo</persName> - in his wretched state - and the last day of our stay we went out to <persName ref="#Costantini_David">David Costantini’s</persName> 
			beautiful house and had tea.  <persName ref="#Costantini_Mrs">Mrs. Costantini</persName> was in <placeName ref="#Paris">Paris</placeName> - we are leaving on the

			<p>We had 5 miserable days in <placeName ref="#Milan">Milan</placeName>.  <persName ref="#Davis_Theodore">Theo</persName> was so suffering.  We were as usual at that pleasant 
			<unclear>Cavour</unclear>, and <persName ref="#Buttles_Jeanette">Nettie</persName> and <persName ref="#Burton_Harry">Harry</persName> went with us to see us off to <placeName ref="#London">London</placeName>.  <placeName ref="#Davis_Theodore">Theo</placeName> fortunately found

			ride to <placeName ref="#Pas-de-Calais">the Calais landing</placeName>, and on Tuesday afternoon at 5 o’clock we reached <placeName ref="#London">London</placeName>,

			<p>We are finally off for home tomorrow, and will sail on the <name type="boat" ref="#Kronprinzessen Cecèlia">Kronprinzessen Cecèlia</name>.

			so useful and kind, and a great comfort.  Our greatest pleasure was going to the 
			International Flower Show, held in <placeName ref="#Chelsea_Physic_Garden">Chelsea Gardens</placeName> - a wonderful thing! Then we made 
			a visit to <placeName ref="#Guildford">Guildford</placeName> to see <pb n="104"/> <persName ref="#Upton_Mr">Mr. Upton</persName> and to see his garden - and order some rock plants.  There are so many all
