                        <persName ref="#Andrews_Emma_B">Emma B. Andrews</persName> is best remembered
                        for her association with the millionaire lawyer turned archaeologist/art and

                        with him between 1889 and 1912, she kept detailed journals of these voyages

                                ref="#Andrews_Emma_B">Emma</persName> provides a vital commentary on the
                        archaeology and pioneering Egyptologists of the time. She paints a revealing
                        picture of the lives of the colonial gentry and the cultural and scientific
                        literati in <placeName ref="#Egypt">Egypt</placeName> at the dawn of the
                        twentieth century. To date, her diaries are unpublished; analysis of the
                        contents of 19 volumes will afford scholars and a general audience information
                        about an important historical resource for the first time. Since its inception
                        in 2010, the scope of our project has broadened to include the transcription and
                        digitization of a wide range of primary historical material from the 'Golden
                        Age' of Egyptian archaeology detailed in the Research section of this website.
                        The Emma B. Andrews Diary Project is one of the founding partners of Newbook

                <p>After a hurried and tiring week spent in New York at that perfect hotel, the St.
                    Dennis, we sailed on Saturday the 16, for Egypt via Naples on that ship well
                    known to us, the "Berlin", on which we have crossed for two years. Only, this
                    time I was not upstairs in the Captain’s room as usual. We have <persName
                        ref="#Newberry_Mary">Mary Newberry</persName> and her daughter, <persName
                        ref="#Newberry_Doris">Doris</persName>, with us, making their first
                    acquaintance with these southern waters. But we are unfortunate - for our second
                    day out was bad - the wind and sea increasing in violence, and for 24 hours it
                    was terrific - it is now better, but the rain and mist continue, and we have
                    only caught a glimpse of the Azores - which we are now passing.</p>

                <p>We dropped our anchor about 2 o’clock at Gibraltar. Most of the passengers went

                    waiting for us. The pleasant old appartment at the Grand Hotel - a tea at

                    passage over a summer sea, and Egypt at last, and once again. How glad we were

                <p>We are now established on our boat - waiting for our tug - which should arrive in
                    the morning. How pleasant it is! after a whole month from home spent in hotels
                    and steamers! It has been a busy week in Cairo - <persName ref="#Newberry_Mary"

                        <persName ref="#Davis_Theodore">Theo</persName>. We spoke of the magnificent

                    never been shown to the public and is kept entirely apart in a private room. A
                    man capable of repairing it has been found, and has agreed to do the whole thing
                    and to finish it within 5 months. The gold work, as well as the exquisite
                        <emph>inlay</emph> - it will be a grand addition to <persName

                <p>This is our record for the week - very high wind from the time we left Luxor.
                    Stopped at Edfou - Kom Ombo - where we were held some time by furious wind -
                    after leaving we passed the most wonderful mass of flamingoes - absolutely dense
                    masses of them - attending a mile or two - very remarkable - reached Aswan the
                    4th. The wind horridly bad. <persName ref="#Newberry_Mary">Mary</persName> and
                        <persName ref="#Newberry_Doris">Doris</persName> went to Barrage - the next

                        >Grenfell's</persName> tomb, and the girls visited them. The 7th we left
                    Aswân, the terrific wind still holding - so that we were tied up some time <pb
                        n="111"/>below Kom Ombo - the next day we stuck upon 3 sand banks, or rather
                    our tug did - and reached here this morning.</p>

                <p>We left the boat very reluctantly several days ago, that charming little home,
                    and came to the Ghizereh Palace Hotel - and into our old rooms. Hotel almost

                    and long one - and a great convenience - but it spoils the garden somewhat.

                    all this way up, covered with snow. We came to the Grande Bretagne and to our
